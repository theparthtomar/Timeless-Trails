        <p class="desr">The Chola kings’ achievements in architecture are perfectly exemplified in this temple. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, Raja Raja Chola I’s display of might is a tribute. The Brihadeeswara Temple in India is one of the country’s greatest architectural wonders. It stands amid massive walls that date back to the 16th century, if not earlier.
            <br><b>History of the Brihadeeswara temple:</b><br>
            From the fifth through the ninth centuries, a spectrum of Hindu temple styles continued to emerge under the control of the Chalukyas, as indicated by the temples at Aihole, Badami, and Pattadakal, and later under the rule of the Pallavas, as evidenced by the temples at Mamallapuram and other sites. Between 850 and 1280 CE, the Cholas rose to prominence as the ruling dynasty. Cholas placed a higher priority on maintaining their
             geopolitical borders during the early Chola period while placing less emphasis on building. In the tenth century, architectural characteristics such as multifaceted columns with
             projecting square capitals began to be developed within the Chola empire. The beginning of the new Chola style, according to George Michell, was signified by this event. The term “note” refers to the first letter of the word “note.” When it comes to grandeur and intricacy, the Brihadeeswara temple, erected between 1003 and 1010 by Chola monarch Rajaraja I, is the best example of this South Indian architecture.
